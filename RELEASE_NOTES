Minimum Profit Release Notes
============================

3.3.18b
-------

 * New russian translation.
 * The replacement pattern in 'replace' now expands slashed characters
   as \t and \n (bug #1095).

3.3.18a
-------

 * Updated german translation.
 * New swedish translation.

3.3.18
------

 * Avoid hangs when using 'aspell' instead of 'ispell' (bug #1090).
 * GTK default font size set to 12 (bug #1093, Debian 352284).
 * GTK font size isn't forced to integer values (bug #1091, suggested
   by Khiraly).
 * Mention that sample configuration files are in /usr/share/doc/mped
   (bug #1094, Debian 352282).
 * A new configuration directive, move_seek_to_line , to set a line
   on screen where all successful text searches are shown (bug #1092,
   suggested by hfrye).

3.3.17
------

 * Fixed a bug in the GTK version introduced by newer versions of
   pango; with some fonts, the average char width was not correctly
   returned and the cursor moved further the right margin without the
   text scrolling to the left.
 * Minor bug fixes: added handling of the keypad Enter key under GTK
   and fixed a crash on GTK 1.x on SunOS when closing the application
   with multiple documents open.
 * mp_doccer is no longer included in Minimum Profit.

3.3.16
------

 * The special file name - (hyphen) can be used to read from stdin
   and write to stdout, making mp useful as a pager or filter (but only
   usable with the GTK interface).
 * A new configuration file directive has been added, wheel_scroll_rows,
   to set the number of lines to move per hit to the mouse wheel.

3.3.15
------

 * Spellchecking support has been added. You need the ispell package
   and the corresponding dictionaries to use it.

3.3.14
------

 * New syntax highlight for LaTeX documents.
 * New syntax highlight for diff files.
 * A new configuration file directive for the GTK interface, gtk_maximize,
   to maximize the main window on startup, has been added.

3.3.13
------

 * Menu definition behaviour have changed. Due to a (probably very old)
   bug, whenever a menu entry was defined in the configuration file, the
   menu was reset to empty; so, to add your own menu bar to the existing
   menu, you had to duplicate all default menu entries (probably copying
   them from mprc.sample). This is, obviously, not what I intended; in
   fact, the 'menu_reset' configuration directive was created precisely
   to do that if you wanted to rewrite your menu from scratch. As I don't
   use customized menus myself, I didn't realize this was happening. I've
   fixed it, so all menu definitions in mprc are appended to the default
   menu, but if you have redefined it, remember to add the 'menu_reset'
   directive just before the 'menu' and 'menu_item' directives or you'll
   get duplicated entries.
 * The german translation has been updated (patch by Ronny Steiner).

3.3.12
------

 * A command line argument in the form +NNN forces the first open
   file's cursor to move to the NNN line. Added for compatibility
   with other text editors.
 * Cancelling the 'exec-command' no longer give spurious errors.
 * Fixed non-printable character detection in some architectures.
 * Small build / install improvements; permissions in .mo files
   have been fixed (patch by David Jensen), the mkinstalldirs script
   is used (also suggested by David Jensen), the CFLAGS environment
   variable is back (the config.sh script was ignoring it).
 * The italian translation has been updated (patch by Andrea).

3.3.11
------

 * The GTK 2.x version now has support for the Pango library, active by
   default. Pango adds support for antialiased fonts. Though they look
   arguably better, they also penalize the overall performance on slow
   machines, so they can be disabled by adding "use_pango: 0" to the
   configuration file.
 * Screen management under GTK has been optimized somehow, so it should
   feel faster overall.
 * A new editor function has added, 'prev', to move backwards in the list
   of open documents. It is not bound to any key by default, so if you
   want to use it, bind it.
 * The editor function 'document-list' (bound by default to Ctrl-O) shows
   a list with the currently open documents and allows one to be selected
   as the active one. This list marks now (with an asterisk) the modified
   documents, and the active one is selected (instead of the first in the
   list as in previous versions).
 * The icon for the GTK version was lost.
