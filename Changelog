------------------------------------

   of mpi_draw_all() that does not do any color tests. This

3.0.98l - mar abr 24 20:27:13 CEST 2001
---------------------------------------

 - New feature: templates (see README for details)

 - New -bw|--monochrome switch.

3.0.98k - jue abr 12 08:52:14 CEST 2001
---------------------------------------

 - New --mode to override syntax hilight detection (suggested by
   Adrian Knoth).

 - The open file list is not showed if no or just one file matched
   the globbing.

 - Got rid of GLOB_BRACE & GLOB_TILDE, that aren't available in
   non-GNU glob() and wasn't being correctly used anyway.

 - New compilation directives: WITHOUT_GLOB, for systems without
   globbing function, and DEFAULT_TAB_SIZE, for setting the default
   tab size.

 - Makefile can now be used as is in BeOS.

3.0.98j - mié mar 28 15:27:59 CEST 2001
---------------------------------------

 - New command line switch, --hardware-cursor or -hw, to make the
   real ('hardware') cursor follow the edit one. This is not done

 - The 'exit' menu command (unix version) now really exits.

3.0.98i - lun feb 19 18:53:02 CET 2001
--------------------------------------

 - Unix/Linux version: when the file to open (F3 key) has at least an *, it
   offers a selection list with the files matching the glob.

3.0.98h - mié feb 14 21:56:17 CET 2001
--------------------------------------

 - Ctrl-F12 maximizes/unmaximizes the window in win32.

 - The scroll bar now works in win32.

--------------------------------------

 - More command line parsing fixes.

3.0.98f - dom ene 28 11:50:42 CET 2001
--------------------------------------

 - Better command line options processing (just cosmetic).

3.0.98e - mar ene 23 21:59:21 CET 2001
--------------------------------------

 - Cursor positioning with mouse under ncurses is now selectable with an
   argument (--mouse) and disabled by default (I think it's better to
   paste from another X Window with a third button click than just putting
   the cursor here and there, and both things are impossible).

 - Menu entries 'Word wrap', and 'Tab size' has now ellipsis at the end,
   marking them as options that ask for more information.

3.0.98d - dom ene  7 21:25:41 CET 2001
--------------------------------------

 - When a tag is found, the search string is copied into the search
   buffer, to get back to tag by pressing ^L (search next).

3.0.98c - lun dic 18 23:46:18 CET 2000
--------------------------------------

 - Bug fixed in parameter line parsing (--word-wrap and --col80 couldn't
   be used together).

3.0.98b - jue dic 14 19:23:53 CET 2000
--------------------------------------

 - Added a new menu option (Mark 80th Column) and argument switch
   (--col80) to toggle a color mark in the 80th column. Not very useful,
   but handy to know if you are indenting your code or mail message too far.

3.0.98 - lun dic 11 16:47:51 CET 2000
-------------------------------------

 - Added a vertical scrollbar to reflect viewport position and scale.
   As it's read-only (that is, it doesn't accept input), it must rather
   be called a 'vertical gauge' or somewhat. Anyway, it shows the
   relationship between what is seen on screen, cursor position and total
   size of the document. It should accept mouse input, but not tonight.

3.0.97b - lun dic  4 16:01:59 CET 2000
--------------------------------------

 - New --version-only argument, that just prints the version and exits.
   Why for? you ask. Well, it's just for using it from artemus (my html
   preprocessor) to update triptico.com. A really minor update.

3.0.97a - mié nov 29 18:15:12 CET 2000
--------------------------------------

 - Changed cursor color from white on black to black on white +
   inverse, as it wasn't working correctly with some terminal emulators.

3.0.97 - mar nov 28 17:14:05 CET 2000
-------------------------------------

 - Included support for ncurses mouse events, where available. Left mouse
   button positions the cursor and right button marks start / end of block.

3.0.96b - jue nov 23 09:31:37 CET 2000
--------------------------------------

 - You can redirect a text to the standard input of a 'System Command...',
   by preceding its name with a '|' (pipe). If not, it works as usual,
   inserting the standard output of the command into the text. Useful for
   printing a text (type |lpr or |a2ps), or mailing it (|mail user@host).

3.0.96a - mié nov 22 15:58:17 CET 2000
--------------------------------------

 - Changed the colors (once again!). This must be the definitive set, at
   least this week's.

3.0.96 - lun nov 20 17:36:30 CET 2000
-------------------------------------

 - Syntax hilighting for source code comments is working (finally!).

 - Bug fix: invoking a macro while recording it caused a SIGSEGV.

3.0.95d - dom nov 19 23:23:22 CET 2000
--------------------------------------

 - Slightly touched mps_word_color() to treat as a literal number every
   word preceded by - (minus).

3.0.95c - sáb nov 18 11:13:51 CET 2000
--------------------------------------

 - New option --alt-color, a hack for choosing an alternate color profile
   for low contrast displays (red/yellow menu).

3.0.95b - sáb nov 18 09:35:30 CET 2000
--------------------------------------

 - Corrected a bug in Perl syntax highlighter.

 - New syntax highlighter: rfc822, to highlight the headers of a rfc822
   message (in order to use mp to edit messages with mutt and its
   'edit_headers' option).

3.0.95 - mar nov 14 19:59:41 CET 2000
-------------------------------------

 - Got rid of mp-synhi.conf. Syntax hilighting definition still sucks,
   but at least mp doesn't depend of anything else. Please delete that .conf
   file from /etc and forget about it (I know, you all hated it too).

3.0.94w - dom nov 12 12:41:46 CET 2000
--------------------------------------

 - The 'w' in 3.0.94w is because these changes are only because of the
   win32 version (it hadn't been modified in months).

 - Slightly modified 'mpv_add_menu' function in unix version, to ignore
   the & char and to let the menu first letter appear underlined in win32.
   This thing was already done in mpv_add_item_menu, but not in the latter.

 - Deleted some useless '#define' in win32 resource file (really old!).

 - Option 'exec command' disabled in win32 version, as it can hang the
   entire machine (good os, this ms windows thing), and it woudn't work
   anyway as stdin/stdout in windows is crap (as almost anything).

 - Options 'replace', 'word wrap' and 'tab size' work now. Replace is rather
   odd, as it doesn't show a 2 text fields + a checkbox, but three different
   dialog boxes, one after the other. A real shit, but it works.

 - Spanish menu 'Fichero' changed to 'Archivo' (I don't like it, but seems
   the most used).

3.0.94c - sáb nov 11 20:43:20 CET 2000
--------------------------------------

 - Fixed a bug when using '-t' and '-w' arguments together.

 - Fixed another bug in Tab Size option (check the return values, guy! :-)

3.0.94b - vie nov 10 23:54:27 CET 2000
--------------------------------------

 - Menu options 'word wrap' and 'tab size' works now.

3.0.94 - mié nov  8 20:31:36 CET 2000
-------------------------------------

 - New 'System command' menu option, to insert the standard output
   of a program into the active document.

 - Slightly changed menu color.

 - Makefile includes a semi-automatic language selection
   (can be overridden).

3.0.93 - nov 5 2000
-------------------

 - Record Macro (F10) and Play Macro (F7) functions.

 - New 'About...' menu option, showing the license.

3.0.92 - oct 30 2000
--------------------

 - Ctags and Exuberant Ctags support, using -t switch (as in vi) and
   from the popup menu.

3.0.91 - sep 27 2000
--------------------

 - Started writing this changelog.

 - New 'Help on Keys' menu option.

3.0.90 - sep 7 2000
-------------------

 - Several minor bug fixes.

3.0.89 and less...
------------------

 - Lost in the mist of time...

1.1.12B - sep 11 1991
---------------------

 - My son Victor was born while I was working in an interface widget to show
   a selection list as combo boxes.

1.1 - jun 1991
--------------

 - Med splits in two main projects: MVE (the window / interface environment)
   and the text editor itself.

1.0 - March 1991
----------------

 - The very first version of mp, then called Med. An MSDOS exec, limited
   to aprox. 400k in all text files in memory.
