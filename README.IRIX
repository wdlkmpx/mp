Building Minimum Profit under SGI IRIX
======================================

Standard build should work:

    $ ./config.sh
    $ make

If GNU cc is found, it will be used instead of SGI's native compiler. Indeed,
I haven't tested it with SGI's cc, as I don't own a CC license on my O2.

You can obtain many GNU software from http://freeware.sgi.com.
