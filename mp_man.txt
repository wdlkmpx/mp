 Minimum Profit - Programmer text editor

SYNOPSIS
--------

 mp [options] [file [file...]]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Minimum Profit (mp) is a text editor for programmers. Among its features
are the following:

 - Multiple files can be edited at the same time and blocks copied
   and pasted among them.
 - Syntax highlighting for many popular languages / file formats: C, C++,
   Perl, Shell Scripts, Ruby, Php, SQL, Python, HTML...
 - Creative use of tags: tags created by the external utility _ctags_
   are used to move instantaneously to functions or variables inside
   your current source tree. Tags are visually highlighted (underlined),
   and symbol completion can be triggered to avoid typing your own function
   names over and over.
 - Intelligent help system: pressing F1 over any word of a text being edited
   triggers the underlying system help (calling _man_ when editing C or Shell
   files, _perldoc_ with Perl, _ri_ on Ruby, _winhelp_ on MS Windows...).
 - Understandable interface: drop-down menus, reasonable default key bindings.
 - Configurable keys, menus and colors.
 - Text templates can be easily defined / accessed.
 - Multiplatform: Console/curses, GTK+ (1.2 and 2.0), MS Windows.
 - Automatic indentation, word wrapping, internal _grep_, learning /
   repeating functions.
 - Search and replace using plain text or regular expressions (including
   a special function to replace text on all open files).
 - Small memory footprint.
 - Spellchecking support (via the ispell package).
 - Multilingual.
 - It helps you abandon vi, emacs and other six-legged freaks definitely.
 - Awesome easter egg.

OPTIONS
-------

The following options are avaiable:

 * -t tag: Edits the file where tag is defined (see ctags(1)).
 * -w column: Sets word wrapping to column. By default, no word
   wrapping is done.
 * -ts number: Sets visual tab size. By default is 8.
 * -ai: Activates automatic indentation. Disabled by default.
 * -l lang: Selects text messages and menus to _lang_ language.
   Run mp --help to see a list of available languages. By default,
   the LANG language variable is tested and used if the language is
   available, falling back to english otherwise.
 * -m mode: Forces a syntax highlight mode. Run mp --help to see a
   list of available syntax highlight modes. By default, mode is
   autodetected for each open file.
 * --col80: Marks column # 80 in a different color.
 * -bw: Starts in black and white (monochrome) mode.
 * -tx: Start in text mode (instead of GUI). By default, GUI modes
   (if support for any of them is compiled in) are tested first and
   used if the environment is suitable (by connecting to an Xserver,
   for example). This option forces the usage of text modes only.
 * -sp: Enable spellchecking. The ispell package should be installed
   and correctly configured.
 * -h: Shows a brief help screen.

The following options are available for the curses interface:

 * -hw: Activates 'hardware cursor'. By default, current cursor position
   is only marked with color. Setting this function the 'blinking'
   hardware cursor will be used. Probably useful only on real text
   console (not in graphical terminal emulators).
 * --mouse: Activates mouse usage for cursor positioning. Mouse
   support is only available if compiled with the ncurses library.
   Enabling this option will allow cursor positioning with the left
   mouse button and beginning / end of block marking with the right one.
 * -nt: Disable transparent mode. Only for terminal emulators.

The following options are available for the GTK interface:

 * --geometry geospec: Sets the window geometry as an X11 geometry
   spec, in the format WxH[+X+Y].
