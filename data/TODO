Minimum Profit TODO / Bug List
==============================

Open Bugs
---------

 * 1000: Word wrap seems to be broken in some special cases.
 * 1002: Autoindent doesn't work when word wrap is active.
 * 1024: When a toggle function is called, the proper menu item
   is not refreshed.
 * 1030: The _mp_save_tabs flag does nothing. Treatment should be
   added to mp_write_open_file().

   plain strstr().
 
Pending Enhancements
--------------------

 * 1011: Take a look at the elinks source to see how wheel-mouse can be
   used in rxvt and xterm.
 * 1012: The tag list should be browseable, as well as the list selection
   file in the curses version.
 * 1013: Tags, files to be open, templates and such things should be shown
   in something like Mozilla's sidebar or so.
 * 1014: Add 'undo'.
 * 1075: In the curses version, the list of open files in the
   title line should show the active text centered.
