Closed
------

 * 1021: When there are no config files (system-wide nor user ones),
   the template file name is left unparsed (leading ~ is not expanded).
   (Thu, 02 Sep 2004 14:04:18 +0200).
 * 1020: Autoindent should only be applied to spaces and tabs, and not
   to separators (Thu, 02 Sep 2004 15:41:07 +0200).
 * 1023: Menus are being built before reading the configuration
   files, so the status of some toggleable variables is not
   correctly shown (Fri, 03 Sep 2004 16:23:15 +0200).
 * 1022: Add a user-selectable capability to unlink files before
   overwriting them (break hardlinks) (Fri, 03 Sep 2004 16:23:15 +0200).

   flickering (Mon, 13 Sep 2004 15:33:40 +0200).
 * 1010: By using the tags, each time the cursor is over one, the tag
   target should be shown in the status line, allowing the function

 * 1032: ctrl-k is not being processed (Sun, 19 Sep 2004 15:50:45 +0200).

   (Thu, 23 Sep 2004 13:55:07 +0200).

 * 1040: Document file encryption in the README
   (Sun, 26 Sep 2004 17:19:06 +0200).
 * 1041: There is a pitfall when using encrypted files; if you open
   a file with the incorrect password, useless garbage will be open,
   as there is no way of detecting incorrect passwords. But, if you
   later save the garbage (probably accidentally), it will be
   re-encrypted with the (still remembered) incorrect password,
   effectively destroying the original information.
   (Sun, 26 Sep 2004 17:24:33 +0200).
 * 1044: When forcing a mode (as in -m mail) and saving an <unnamed>
   file, its name in the tab does not change
   (Tue, 05 Oct 2004 20:36:37 +0200).
 * 1045: mpv_win32.c needs to trigger the bindings for WM_CHAR only
   if there was no appropriate binding for WM_KEYDOWN
   (Wed, 06 Oct 2004 16:17:51 +0200).

   libintl.h, i.e., MS Windows) (Sat, 16 Oct 2004 09:44:42 +0200).
 * 1047: If you define more menu's than the screen allows, the last
   menus will not show up properly (Tue, 19 Oct 2004 23:17:28 +0200).
 * 1048: Delete key (0x7f) in curses does not work
   (Tue, 19 Oct 2004 23:17:28 +0200)
 * 1049: curses resize terminal not working (Tue, 19 Oct 2004 23:17:28 +0200).

 * 1056: Add conditional construct to mprc (Tue, 19 Oct 2004 23:17:28 +0200).
 * 1059: As the 'paste' editor function saves state, it can no longer
   be used to reformat paragraphs when word wrapping is enabled; a new
   'reformat-paragraph' function is needed (Thu, 21 Oct 2004 17:40:54 +0200).
 * 1061: Add syntax highlight for .mprc files (Sat, 23 Oct 2004 09:41:37 +0200).
 * 1057: Open file list in curses should be navigable
   (Sun, 24 Oct 2004 09:40:38 +0200).
 * 1060: The GTK open file dialogs should remember the last directory
   (Mon, 25 Oct 2004 16:11:24 +0200).

   character over the cursor (Wed, 03 Nov 2004 17:29:37 +0100).
 * 1066: The function toggle-column-80 no longer works (it has no
   translated text, and it does not activate its function)
   (Thu, 11 Nov 2004 18:24:12 +0100).
 * 1067: Whenever a toggleable menu option is triggered, a new,
   bogus menu is created (Thu, 11 Nov 2004 18:35:02 +0100).
